    <h2>
        What I have learned from the German IOI selection
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            basically intro to the world of competitive programming.
        </li>
        <li>
            learned C++ form scratch
        </li>
        <li>
            learned how to implement most of the algorithms I got to know in the <a href="./../bwinf/bwinf.html">Bundeswettbewerb Informatik</a> as I just knew how they worked in principle as of then, gained a lot of in-depth knowledge about implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            (learned that I suck in competitive programming)
        </li>
