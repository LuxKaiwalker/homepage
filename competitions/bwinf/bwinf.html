        What I have learned from Bundeswettbewerb Informatik
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Basically it was my into to computer science as i learned python in from scratch in order to implement solutions, and i delved quite deep ino Algorithms and data structures in order to come up with solutions. The book I mainly used for preparing can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/4ihCQjT">here</a>.
