            Target: High school students in Germany or international german schools
        </li>
        <li>
            Rounds: 3. First two rounds are theoretical rounds where a solution and corresponding documentation has to be submitted. The third round is a practical round where Students have to talk to professors in form of a Kolloquium and work in teams.

    <h2>
        My Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
        I participated in the Bundeswettbewerb Informatik in 2024. As I did not have very much experience in programming computers yet and there is no computer science subject in my school back then, I hoped to learn what programming and computer science is about in the very first place. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At first, I was surprised that I made the first round at all as I had to learn python as a programming language from the very beginning and I did not expect to be able to write satisfactory solutions to the tasks. My qualification to the second round granted me a lot of exciting opportunities to meet interesting people who encouraged me to then finally give it a serious try for the second round. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Somehow I managed to get into the third round, and I met the most promising talents of computer science there. The level of expertise was very high, and I encountered many extraordinary and impressive individuals who were deeply passionate about computer science. Somehow, I managed to come up with a creative solution to the task and I was able to present it in a way that impressed the jury. I was awarded a special prize for the best team presentation for that.

    <h2>
        What I have learned from Bundeswettbewerb Informatik
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Basically it was my into to computer science as i learned python in from scratch in order to implement solutions, and i delved quite deep ino Algorithms and data structures in order to come up with solutions. The book I mainly used for preparing can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/4ihCQjT">here</a>.
