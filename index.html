                    Hi.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am really glad that you found your way to my homepage. My name is Vincent and I am currently finding my passion for computer science and trying to see how to make a meaningful impect on this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am still studying in high school (Gymnasium) in Germany. In order to find out more about topics I am interested in, I started a bunch of projects to gain insight into various fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explore web development, I made this homepage to experiment with different frontend tools in order to gain a cool insight into how frontend development might work out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, my homepage may still look kind of crappy, but this is a reflective journey of my real frontend skills. I want to keep it clean and based, so everything you are sseing here is real skill I have aquired. No fancy templated, no frameworks (yet). Probably the website will have an entirely different design if you come to visit it later, as I am constantly learning to improve my web developement skills!
