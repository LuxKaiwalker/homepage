                    Hi.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am really glad that you found your way to my homepage. My name is Vincent and I am currently finding my passion for computer science and trying to make a meaningful impact on this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am still studying in high school (Gymnasium) in Germany. In order to find out more about topics I am interested in, I started a bunch of projects to gain insight into various fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explore web development, I made this homepage to experiment with different frontend tools in order to gain a cool insight into how frontend development might work out!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, my homepage may still look kind of crappy, but this is a reflective journey of my real frontend skills. I want to keep it clean and based, so everything you are sseing here is real skill I have aquired. No fancy templated, no frameworks (yet). Probably the website will have an entirely different design if you come to visit it later, as I am constantly learning to improve my web developement skills!

            <!--<div class="dante">
                <p>
                    As Dante writes in his <i>Divine Comedy</i>, I believe that it is natural for humans to strive for greater things, even if they seem to be out of reach just yet. As long as we can witness the transcedent beauty of the unreachable again, I believe that we can find the strength to keep on going, even through Hell. And this strenghth, out of irony, seems to be the force which will make the unreachable reality.
