                    Hi.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I am really glad that you found your way to my homepage. I am Vincent and I am currently understanding that there are too many things I need to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am still studying in high school (Gymnasium) in Germany. In order to find out more about topics I am interested in, I started a bunch of projects to gain insight into various fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To explore web development, I made this homepage to experiment with different frontend tools in order to gain a insight into how everything works out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of now, my homepage may still look kind of crappy, as this is a reflective journey of my real frontend skills. Probably the website will have an entirely different design if you come to visit it later, as I am constantly learning to improve my coding skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore my journey so far, including what I’ve accomplished and what I’m currently working on. I hope my projects and competitions provide insight into my interests and skills, and perhaps even inspire you to embark on exciting endeavors of your own!
