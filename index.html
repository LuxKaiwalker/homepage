        About me and this page
    </h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my homepage! I am really glad that you found it here. I am currrently finding my passion for computer science and trying to see how to develop my career into the direction i want.
        <br>
        Currently, I am still studying in high school (Gymnasium) in Germany. In order to find out more about topics I am interested in, I started a bunch of projects to gain insight into various fields.
        <br>
        In order to explore Web developement, I made this homepage to experiment with different frontend tools in order to gain a cool insight of how frontend developement might work out!
        <br>
        As of now, my homepage may still look kind of crappy, but this is a reflective journey of my real frontend skills so I want to keep it clean and based. I dont want to use any fancy stuff I have not mastered yet so I dont get lost in the messy world of frontend developement. Probably the website will have a entirely different design if you come to visit it later!
