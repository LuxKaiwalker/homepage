            About me and this page
        </h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my homepage! I am really glad that you found your way to my homepage. I am currently finding my passion for computer science and trying to see how to develop my career into the direction I want.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am still studying in high school (Gymnasium) in Germany. In order to find out more about topics I am interested in, I started a bunch of projects to gain insight into various fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to explore web development, I made this homepage to experiment with different frontend tools in order to gain a cool insight into how frontend development might work out!
        </p>
        <p>
            As of now, my homepage may still look kind of crappy, but this is a reflective journey of my real frontend skills. I want to keep it clean and based. I don’t want to use any fancy stuff I have not mastered yet so I don’t get lost in the messy world of frontend development. Probably the website will have an entirely different design if you come to visit it later!
        </p>
